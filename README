All features specified in the documentation have been provided. A warning
is displayed for the IF / ELSE rule but the parsing of various IF / ELSE
statements have been tested and verified to be parsed correctly.

build comands:
ant antlr:
    generates the .java files from src/frontend/SmallC.g
ant compile:
    runs ant antlr and compiles the .java files
ant jar:
    generates a jar file 
ant build:
    runs ant antlr, ant compile, ant jar
ant run:
    runs the jar file with the whole test suite as input
to run with single file:
   java -jar lib/compiler.jar [name of file]

For testing purposes the entire tests/ directory be passed as an argument.
This will test each file in that directory and produce a .txt file of the
tree for each file. Also, error messages will be printed if a lexical or
syntactical error is found. Individual files can also be passed as an
argument with the same behavior as passing the directory (except only
that file will be parsed).

For testing 38 .c files have been created by myself and 27 files were
created by my colleague Christian Lalanne examining correct versions of
the various rules and incorrect versions of those rules also. For testing
the entire tests/ directory is passed to the compiler and the results can be
examined very easily. To examine the tree a .txt file is generated with the
same name as the input file.
